**Chronic-Kidney-Diseases-Prediction* (CKD) implements ML algorithm- Random Forest for classification. Simple webapp is developed using Flask. The models is used to predict the diseases based on the  trained model on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. 

In this project:
- Identify risk factors for CKD 
- Predict potential CKD subtypes

## Installation Instruction

### Window 
1. conda create -n test python=3.6.7 pip
2. conda activate test
3. pip3 install -r requirements.txt (All reqiured packages are listed on requirements text file)
	```scikit-learn==0.23.0
	flask==1.0.2, scikit-learn==0.23.0,numpy==1.18.1, pandas==1.1.4, matplotlib==3.0.2...

4. go the project main folder (CKD_project) directory 
	```bash
	$> cd. ...\CKD_project_file\CKD_project
	```
5. train the model (train/test results will be saved in respective folder) 
	```bash
	$> ...\CKD_project_file\CKD_project>python train_model.py
	```
6. run python main.py 
	```bash
	$> ...\CKD_project_file\CKD_project>python main.py
	```
7. open  http://localhost:8080/
8. enter the features input on web API and press 'predict' button
